## Why Use Quick Guides?

Pieces Quick Guides help you quickly understand and effectively utilize powerful features like the Long-Term (LTM-2.5) Memory Engine and Pieces Copilot.

Capture context from your browser, summarize meetings with coworkers, find closed GitHub Issues from last month that were just mentioned in that Slack channelâ€”*and thatâ€™s just the beginning.*

You can get a lot done with Pieces, and we want to help you get started!

Visit the links below to read Pieces Quick Guides on various topics, such as using LTM context, adding folders as additional context from different platforms, prompting, and more.
