## Billing

The Billing tab allows you to manage your organization's subscription, view billing details, update seat counts, and configure billing addresses. All billing changes are processed through the *Paddle* payment system.

  <Step title="Navigate to Billing">
    From your *organization overview* page, click `Billing` in the *sidebar* navigation.

### Changing Seat Count

Update the number of seats in your subscription to accommodate more or fewer team members.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Adjust Seat Count">

## Understanding Seat Minimums

Your organization must maintain a minimum number of seats based on your active member count. Understanding seat minimums helps you manage your subscription effectively.

Key points about seat minimums:

* **Active Members** - Each active member requires one seat
* **Minimum Calculation** - Minimum seats = Number of active members
* **Seat Reduction** - You can only reduce seats if you first remove members to free up seats
* **Seat Increase** - You can add seats at any time, which will be billed according to your subscription plan

When you try to reduce seats below the minimum, you'll see a warning indicating how many active members you have and the minimum seat requirement.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand billing, learn about [managing members](/products/organizations-and-teams/managing-members) to track seat usage, or explore [organization settings](/products/organizations-and-teams/organization-settings) to configure team-wide settings.
