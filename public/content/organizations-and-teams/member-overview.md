## Understanding Member Limitations

As a member, you have access to collaboration features but cannot access administrative functions. Understanding these limitations helps you know what you can do and when you might need to contact an Owner or Admin.

<Callout type="info">
  Members cannot access:
  * Member management (inviting, removing, or changing roles)
  * Billing and subscription management
  * Organization settings configuration
  * Team creation or deletion (from settings)
  
  These features are reserved for Owners and Admins. If you need administrative access, contact your organization owner or admin.
</Callout>

## Available Sidebar Navigation

As a member, you can access:

The *sidebar* includes the following navigation options available to members:

* **Overview** - Current page showing recent updates and team activity
* **Members** - View organization members (read-only access)

Administrative sections like *Billing* and *Settings* are not visible to members and are reserved for Owners and Admins.
