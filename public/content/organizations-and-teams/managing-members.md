    In the *Current Members* list, find the member whose role you want to change. Click the vertical ellipsis icon (three dots) next to their name to open the *member options* menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Role">
    Select the role dropdown and choose a new role:
    * **Owner**: Full control including deletion rights
    * **Admin**: Full access except organization deletion
    * **Write**: Can create and edit resources
    * **Read**: View-only access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click `Save` to apply the role change. The member's permissions will update immediately.

## Understanding Seat Management

Seats are tied to your subscription and determine how many active members your organization can have.

Understanding how seats work helps you manage your organization effectively:

* **Active Members** - Each active member uses one seat
* **Minimum Seats** - You must maintain at least one seat based on your number of active members
* **Seat Availability** - Available seats = Total seats - Active members
* **Upgrading** - Increase seats from the *Billing* tab when you need to invite more members

## Next Steps

Now that you understand member management, learn about [billing](/products/organizations-and-teams/billing) to manage your subscription and seat count, or explore [managing teams](/products/organizations-and-teams/managing-teams) to organize members into smaller groups.
