## Having Trouble with Pieces for Jupyter?

If the Pieces for Jupyter Extension isn’t working as expected, verify the following steps:

### Ensure You Have the Latest Versions

Ensure you are using the most recent version of the Pieces for Jupyter Extension available in the PIP marketplace, with a minimum required version of **BLANK**. Additionally, confirm that you have the latest version of PiecesOS, requiring at least version **11.3.6**.

## Check PiecesOS Status

Ensure that PiecesOS is running. It must be active for the Pieces for Jupyter Extension to function correctly.

## Restart Jupyter Lab After Updates

If you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for Jupyter Extension, restart Jupyter Lab to apply the updates properly.

If the issues persist, contact the <a target="_blank" href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-obsidian">Pieces Support Team</a>.

## Refreshing Copilot Chats

If you're using the Pieces Copilot chat and lose your WiFi connection or face problems with a cloud-based LLM, refreshing the chat might be necessary. This action can fix issues like the LLM seemingly "hanging" (for instance, producing a response that times out or gets stuck in an infinite loop).

To refresh the chat, click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of your Copilot Chat window and select `Refresh`.
