## Using the Debugging Tool

To start debugging, locate your project's error or problematic code segment.

<Callout type="tip">
  Errors are usually indicated by **red underscoring** surrounding the error or problematic lines of code.
</Callout>

Then, click the `Yellow Lightbulb` to the left of the buggy code, and click `Pieces: Copilot Fix`.

Pieces Copilot will utilize whichever LLM you have currently active and analyze the issue. Then, it will open a Copilot Chat with suggestions, regenerate the code, and provide the option to insert it at the cursor mark—all with fresh code comments.
