## Introducing Pieces

This documentation is designed to provide a high-level overview of <a target="_blank" href="/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals">Pieces' features and functionalities</a>, with a quick-start and troubleshooting guides for <a target="_blank" href="/products/meet-pieces/macos-installation-guide">macOS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/products/meet-pieces/windows-installation-guide">Windows</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="/products/meet-pieces/linux-installation-guide">Linux</a> to help you get started with Pieces as quickly as possible.

Let’s answer a few basic questions:

### What is Pieces?

At its core, Pieces is an all-in-one productivity tool that helps developers work *smarter*, not harder, by anchoring engineers to their workflow with the power of the **Long-Term Memory Engine, Pieces Drive,** and the **Pieces Copilot.**

There are **\[3]** core pillars of Pieces functionality:

1. [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2.7)](/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#ltm-27): A powerful, AI-powered live context framework that understands what you’re working on across your entire development workflow. The LTM-2.7 helps by outsourcing the burden of memory and retrieval from the developer to AI to maximize space for creativity driven by human intent.

2. [Pieces Drive](/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-drive): The ability to save, search, reference, reuse, and share small developer resources like code snippets, screenshots, links, and text notes.

3. [Pieces Copilot](/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-copilot): An intelligent assistant that helps with generating code, answering questions, and adding code comments while utilizing a LLM of your choice—featuring an adjustable context window ranging from conversation-only to entire project repositories.

### Who is Pieces For?

Everyone. 

Pieces is an *Artificial Memory* tool that remembers your real-world activity and productivity context with Large Language Models (LLMs). It surfaces useful information, answers questions other AI tools can't, keeps you focused, and gives you an edge on the competition.

Pieces is an **excellent productivity option for users of all levels** and across various fields, including front-end developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, and students.

Pieces adapts to YOUR workflow, whether you're coding, researching, writing, or collaborating.

### How do I Use Pieces?

PiecesOS serves as the foundational layer of the entire Pieces Suite, much like Docker does for containerized applications—it powers the Pieces Desktop App along with all our browser and IDE extensions and plugins.

By installing PiecesOS, you enable the full functionality of the desktop app and our extensions, just like how Docker manages various containers.
