## Troubleshooting

If you're seeing a blank upgrade page with a minimal table showing $0.00 for all values, followed by an error that returns you to the previous screen, this is a known issue related to our payments pipeline.

It commonly occurs when **JavaScript is disabled in your browser** or if an **ad blocker** is interfering with the checkout process.

To get around this and continue with the payment process, make sure \[1] JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings and \[2] any ad blockers, privacy extensions, or content filtering tools are temporarily disabled.

Once you've confirmed both, try the upgrade process again.
