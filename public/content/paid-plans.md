| **Feature** | **Free** | **Pieces Pro** |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Cloud / premium AI models | Limited usage | Unlimited access |
| Local models (Ollama) | Full access, no limits | Full access, no limits |
| Long-term memory | Rolling window (time-bound) | Unlimited (up to 9 months) |
| Deep Study reports | — | ✓ |
| AI-powered code generation | Basic | Advanced |
| Support | Community | Priority |
| Cloud backup | Limited | Full |

For details on which models are available on each plan, see [Models](/products/desktop/configuration/models#free-vs-pro-model-access).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does the paid plan affect memory quality or just the built-in chat?">
    Both. Pro gives you longer memory retention *and* access to more powerful models for searching and reasoning over your stored context. The Long-Term Memory engine that captures and organizes your workflow data is the same on both plans—the main differences are *duration* and *retrieval quality*.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does Long-Term Memory last on each plan?">
    The free plan is time-bound: you have access to a rolling window of recent history. Pieces Pro offers unlimited long-term memory with up to 9 months of context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the limits on premium model usage?">
    The free plan includes limited usage of select cloud models to get started. Pro offers unlimited access to premium LLMs including GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and thinking models. [See the full model list](/products/large-language-models/cloud-models) for details on which models are Free vs Pro.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does upgrading to Pro create better memories?">
    No. The engine that captures and organizes your data is the same. Pro users get *longer* retention (up to 9 months vs a rolling window) and can use more powerful models to *search and query* those memories, yielding deeper insights—but the underlying memory formation is identical.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Benefits

Unlimited access to *premium LLMs, infinite long-term memory,* and *priority support* are a combination that empowers your team to code smarter, faster, and with greater confidence.

## Troubleshooting

If you're seeing a blank upgrade page with a minimal table showing $0.00 for all values, followed by an error that returns you to the previous screen, this is a known issue related to our payments pipeline.

It commonly occurs when **JavaScript is disabled in your browser** or if an **ad blocker** is interfering with the checkout process.

To get around this and continue with the payment process, make sure \[1] JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings and \[2] any ad blockers, privacy extensions, or content filtering tools are temporarily disabled.

Once you've confirmed both, try the upgrade process again.
