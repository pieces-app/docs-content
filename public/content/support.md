## Get Support or Submit Feedback

We've got you covered if you’re experiencing an issue or have feedback for the Pieces team.

## Live Support with Pieces

We want to ensure that your experience with PiecesOS, the Pieces Desktop App, and any of our IDE or browser integrations is as smooth and seamless as possible—and part of that is speaking with as many users as possible so we can continue iterating and improving on Pieces products.

If you need help getting everything up and running, feel free to book a call with our Founders & Engineering Leaders via <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ22WJ2Htd2wRMJhueCNYc0xbFBFCAN-khijcuoXACd_Uux3wIhgZeGkzDRcqD3teamAI-CwCHpr">our support calendar.</a>

## Open a GitHub Issue<a target="_blank" href="/products/support#get-support-or-share-feedback">**​**</a>

You can open GitHub issues for PiecesOS, the Pieces Desktop App, or any other Pieces plugin or extension by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues">opening an issue in our GitHub repository.</a>

If you would prefer not to use GitHub, you can still <a target="_blank" href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#page=docs-support">leave feedback or report a bug here.</a>

## Finding your Logs

If opening a GitHub issue, attaching your logs helps developers on the Pieces team better identify issues so we can get you up and running quicker, as well as prevent more bugs in the future.

All you need to do is **\[1]** locate and **\[2]** zip the *Support* folder, then **\[3]** send it to the Pieces technical support team or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues">include it in a GitHub issue.</a>

At any time, you can find your up-to-date log files in the following locations, depending on your platform:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem title="macOS">
    ### macOS

    1. Open **Finder**.

    2. Press `⌘+shift+g` (Go to Folder).

    3. Paste this path and press `return`:

    ```plaintext
    ~/Users/<username>/Library/com.pieces.os/
    ```

    <Callout type="tip">
      Replace `username` with your system username.
    </Callout>

    4. Once inside the folder, open `production` → `Support` to view the logs.

    **Note:** If you don’t see the `Library` folder or certain files, press `⌘+shift+.` (period) to show hidden files in Finder.

       ```

    <Callout type="tip">
