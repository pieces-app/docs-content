## Interactive Terminal Experience

The Pieces CLI Text User Interface (TUI) provides an interactive, terminal-based experience for managing materials and interacting with Pieces Copilot.

When you launch the TUI with `pieces tui`, you're greeted with the Copilot interface featuring a sidebar for navigation, chat area for conversations, and keyboard shortcuts for quick access.

## Workstream Activities

Use `shift+ctrl+w` to navigate to the Workstream view. Once there, you can manage your workstream activities. 

Select an activity from the left sidebar to view its content in read mode or switch to edit mode `ctrl+e` to modify it. Save your changes with `ctrl+s`.
