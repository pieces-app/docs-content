## Managing Workstream Summaries 

Managing multiple workstream summaries at once gives you powerful control over your workflow. With mass selection, you can quickly merge related summaries, delete outdated ones, copy several summaries for sharing, or export a batch for archiving. 

This is useful when you want to consolidate similar content, clean up your activity list, or move information out of Pieces in bulk—all in just a few clicks.

You can perform these actions on a single summary or on multiple summaries at once: merge, copy, export, or delete. Use selection mode to work in bulk.

### Selecting One or Many Summaries

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Item Menu">
    On any summary card, click the three dots (more) menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Select">
    Click `Select` to enter selection mode. Checkboxes appear on summary cards and a toolbar shows at the bottom of the screen.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick Additional Summaries">
    Click the checkbox on any other summaries you want to include. Click a checked card again to deselect it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Exit Selection Mode">
    Click the `X` on the bottom toolbar to cancel selection at any time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Actions Available in Selection Mode

Use the bottom toolbar to act on your selection:

| **Action** | **What it does** |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Merge | Combines selected summaries into a single summary draft that you can review and save. |
| Copy | Copies the content of the selected summaries to your clipboard for pasting elsewhere. |
| Export | Downloads the selected summaries to your device for sharing or archiving. |
| Delete | Removes the selected summaries from Workstream Activity (you'll be asked to confirm). |

<Card title="Notes and Tips">
  <ul>
    <li>Selecting just one summary lets you use the same toolbar to merge, copy, export, or delete that single item.</li>
    <li>Multi-select is ideal for mass deletion, bulk export, or copying a set of related summaries.</li>
    <li>After merging, open the resulting combined summary in the editor to make any final tweaks before saving.</li>
  </ul>
