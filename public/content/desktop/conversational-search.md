## What Is Conversational Search?

**Conversational Search** is the ability to talk with your memories. It's your AI-powered interface for having conversations with your captured workflow context—including code you've written, conversations you've had, and decisions you've made.

You can talk with all your memories, or customize which memories to include by filtering by specific apps and time ranges. Ask specific questions about your past work, and Conversational Search provides contextual answers based on your actual workflow history, powered by [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7)](/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-27) with access to up to 9 months of captured memories.
