## Pieces Drive (Legacy)

**Pieces Drive** is a legacy feature that's being integrated into the [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7)](/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-27) Engine and [Timeline](/products/desktop/timeline) features. Materials and workflow context are now automatically captured and organized by the LTM system, which provides a more seamless and intelligent way to access your development materials.

The LTM-2.7 Engine automatically captures and stores your workflow context—including code snippets, documentation, and related materials—without requiring manual saving or organization. This means you'll have access to your materials through [Timeline](/products/desktop/timeline), where you can view summaries, search through captured context, and interact with your workflow data in a more intuitive way.

You can still access Pieces Drive (Legacy) if you need it, but we recommend using the new LTM-powered features for the best experience.

### Accessing Pieces Drive (Legacy)

To access Pieces Drive (Legacy), click your profile icon in the top-right corner, then navigate to **Settings** → `Drive (Legacy)`. This option is maintained for existing users who may need to access previously saved materials, but new workflows should use the Long-Term Memory system and Timeline features.

### Where to Find These Features Now

The functionality that Pieces Drive provided is now handled by these modern features:

* [Timeline](/products/desktop/timeline)—View incremental workflow summaries, saved context, and related information gathered by the Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7) Engine. This is where you'll find your automatically captured materials and workflow context.

* [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7) Engine](/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-27)—Learn how the LTM system automatically captures and organizes your workflow context, eliminating the need for manual material management.

These features provide the same capabilities that Pieces Drive offered, but with automatic capture, better organization, and seamless integration with Pieces Copilot and other Pieces tools.
