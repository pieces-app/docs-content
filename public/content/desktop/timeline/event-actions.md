## Event Actions and Menus

All events in Pieces Timeline—including conversational searches, Timeline Events (automatically generated summaries like `Day Recap`, `Morning Brief`, `Week Recap`, and `What's Top of Mind`), and single-click summaries—appear in your Timeline and have actions available through the `three-dots menu`. Available actions include favoriting, generating titles (for conversational searches), and deleting events.

Understanding which actions are available helps you manage your Timeline effectively and customize events to fit your workflow needs.

### Favoriting Events

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Event Menu">
    Click the `three-dots menu icon` on any event in Pieces Timeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Favorite">
    Click `Favorite` in the menu to mark the event as a favorite. A star icon appears next to the event in Timeline.

### Generating Titles

Regenerate the title for conversational search events to better reflect their content or purpose. Timeline Events and single-click summaries don't have this option because their titles are already generated by the LTM-2.7 Engine.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Event Menu">
    Click the `three-dots menu icon` on a conversational search event.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Generate Title">
    Click `Generate Title` in the menu. Pieces uses AI to analyze the conversation content and generate a new, more descriptive title that better reflects the conversation's content or main topic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review New Title">
    The event title updates in Timeline and in the event header with the new title.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Use Generate Title when the auto-generated title doesn't accurately describe the conversation, or when you want a more specific or descriptive title for easier searching later.
</Callout>

### Deleting Events

Remove events from your Timeline. Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Event Menu">
    Click the `three-dots menu icon` on any event in Pieces Timeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Delete">
    Click `Delete` in the menu. A confirmation popup appears asking you to confirm the deletion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Review the confirmation message, which shows the event title and warns that "This action cannot be undone."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Delete Button">
    Click the red `Delete` button in the popup to confirm deletion, or click `Cancel` or the `X` icon to close without deleting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Event Removed">
    The event is permanently removed from your Timeline and cannot be recovered.
  </Step>
</Steps>
