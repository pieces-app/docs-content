## LTM Roll-Ups

View detailed summaries of workflow periods automatically generated by LTM-2.7.

LTM Roll-Ups are detailed summaries of your workflow periods, automatically generated approximately every 30 minutes by the [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7)](/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-27) Engine. View them by clicking any activity in the [Timeline Activities](/products/desktop/timeline/timeline-activities) sidebar. Each roll-up includes tasks, decisions, documents, and follow-ups from that time period. You can edit, export, or delete them as needed.

Roll-ups help you understand what happened during specific workflow periods. They capture the context of your work—what you did, why you made certain decisions, and what still needs attention—making it easy to reference past work and understand your workflow patterns.

## Roll-Up Structure

Understand what information is included in each roll-up.

Each roll-up contains structured information about your workflow period, organized into clear sections that make it easy to understand what happened and what's important.

Each roll-up includes:

* **Core Tasks & Projects**—What you worked on and problems solved
* **Key Decisions & Discussions**—Important conversations and choices made
* **Documents & Code Reviewed**—Files and links you accessed (with deep links)
* **Follow-Up Actions**—What still needs attention

Roll-ups created through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations display a "Formed with MCP" indicator.
