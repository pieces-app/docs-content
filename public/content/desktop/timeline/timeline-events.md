## Timeline Events

Timeline Events is the chronological sidebar that displays all activities and conversations captured by the [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7)](/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-27) Engine. Located on the left side of Timeline, it serves as your navigation hub for accessing any past workflow context. The sidebar organizes your activities by date, making it easy to find specific items whether they happened today or months ago.

Click the `Show Timeline` button in the top-left corner of the main view to open or close Pieces Timeline.

## Understanding Activity Items

Each item in Timeline Events contains information about a specific captured activity or conversation from your workflow.

Each memory item displays:

* **Title/Description:** A concise summary of the activity (e.g., "Desktop App Documentation Updates", "SDK, Docs, & Work Ledger").
* **Timestamp:** When the activity occurred (e.g., "10 minutes ago - 2:24pm", "Half an hour ago - 2:04pm").
* **Date Group:** Memories are grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, Last Saturday, Last Sunday, etc.).
* **Emoji/Icon Indicators:** Visual indicators showing the type of activity or associated apps (e.g., 😊 for conversations, 💻 for code, 📄 for documents).
* **App Icons:** Small icons showing which applications were involved (Chrome, VS Code, Slack, etc.).
* **Count Badge:** Number on the right indicating how many events or items are in that memory.

## Navigating Timeline Events

The Timeline Events sidebar provides multiple ways to find and access specific workflow moments.

Date groups include Today, Yesterday, and then specific dates for older activities (e.g., "Last Saturday, Jan 3rd"). Each day section can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide its contents. Scroll down through the sidebar to browse older activities—LTM-2.7 retains your workflow context for up to 9 months.

## Activity Retention

Understand how long your workflow activities are retained.

LTM-2.7 retains your captured workflow context for up to 9 months. This gives you access to a substantial history of your work, allowing you to reference past projects, conversations, and decisions long after they occurred. Activities older than 9 months are automatically removed to ensure optimal performance.

## Tips for Using Timeline Events

Best practices for navigating and using Timeline Events effectively.

Following these tips helps you find and access workflow activities more efficiently.

* Use the search function when you remember specific keywords but not the exact date of an activity
* Date groups make it easy to find activities from "that meeting yesterday" or "the work I did last week"
* The emoji and app icons help you quickly scan the list visually—look for specific patterns that match what you're searching for
* If you're looking at a roll-up and want to see where it is in your chronological history, use the `Jump to Summary In List` button
* Keep the Timeline Events sidebar open while working to quickly reference past context without losing your place
