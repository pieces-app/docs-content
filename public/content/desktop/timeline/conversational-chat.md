## Conversational Chat

**Conversational Chat** is your conversational interface for asking questions about your workflow. Powered by the [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7)](/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-27) Engine with access to up to 9 months of captured context, it searches your actual memories—conversations, documents, commits, and decisions.

Unlike generic AI, responses reference your specific work. Related Roll-Ups cards below responses reveal which memories were used.

## Getting Started

### Suggested Prompts

Three contextual prompt buttons appear based on your recent activity. Click any prompt to instantly ask that question.

Prompts update dynamically (e.g., "Summarize my memories", "Document onboarding changes"). Click the refresh icon next to the **CONVERSATIONAL CHAT** header for new suggestions.

### Starting a Chat

Click the `Start New Chat` button (blue, bottom-right). Type naturally: "What did I work on yesterday?" or "Find that Slack conversation about API changes." Press Enter to send.

## How It Works

### Context-Aware Responses

When you ask a question, Conversational Chat searches your captured memories for relevant context. It references your specific activities, not generic AI knowledge, providing personalized answers based on your actual work.

It can recall specific conversations, documents, decisions, and problems you've encountered.

### Related Roll-Ups

Below each response, "Related Workstream Activities" cards appear showing which specific memories were used in the answer.

Each card is clickable and takes you to full LTM Roll-Up details, providing transparency into where information came from.

## Choosing Your AI Model

### Model Selector (Bottom-Left Corner)

The model selector shows **Recent models** and **Suggested models** sections.

* **Cloud models** (Claude 4.1 Opus, Claude 4 Sonnet, etc.)—Faster responses and advanced reasoning.
* **Local models** (o3, o1, GPT-4, etc.)—Complete privacy and work offline.

Click any model name to switch. Use the "All Models" button to see the complete list.

### Additional Controls (Bottom Toolbar)

* **Sources**—Control which data sources are used.
* **Time Ranges**—Filter memories by time period.
* **Activate DeepStudy**—Enhanced research mode for comprehensive analysis.

## Asking Effective Questions

**Questions that work well:**

* **Time-based**: "What did I work on yesterday afternoon?", "Summarize my week"
* **Topic-specific**: "Find conversations about the API redesign"
* **Decision recall**: "Why did we decide to use PostgreSQL?"
* **Reference finding**: "Find that link about React performance"
* **Summary requests**: "Give me a recap of client feedback"

**Making questions more specific:** Include timeframes ("yesterday", "last week", "between Monday and Wednesday") and mention projects, people, or topics ("work on the dashboard", "conversations with Tom"). Use follow-up questions—the chat maintains conversation context.

## Managing Chats

Chats auto-save and appear in the [Timeline Activities](/products/desktop/timeline/timeline-activities) sidebar, listed chronologically with other workflow activities.

Click previous chats in the sidebar to continue conversations. Use `Start New Chat` for fresh conversations on new topics.

## Tips & Best Practices

* Start with suggested prompts to discover what works, then adapt them to your needs.
* Be specific with timeframes: "last Tuesday" works better than "recently".
* Check Related Roll-Ups to verify information sources and access full context.
* Use follow-up questions to dig deeper—context is maintained within conversations.
* Try different models for different tasks (local for privacy, cloud for speed).
* Remember: Conversational Chat only knows about your captured workflow—not work done before you started using Pieces or in applications where LTM is disabled.
