## Pieces Copilot | Main View

When you launch the Pieces Desktop App, you are greeted by the **Pieces Copilot View**—a dynamic, context-rich chat interface designed to help you interact with powerful generative AI, manage your project context, and streamline your coding workflow.

Inside the Pieces Copilot view, you can:

1. Interact with advanced [local and cloud-hosted LLMs](/products/desktop/copilot/interaction) for multi-purpose generative AI needs.

2. Leverage [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7) context captured by PiecesOS](/products/desktop/copilot/integration) to enhance AI responses.

3. Attach and manage folders, files, saved materials, and websites as [chat context.](/products/desktop/copilot/integration#adding-folders)

4. Search and [add saved code snippets as additional context](/products/desktop/copilot/integration#enriching-chats-with-saved-materials) to Pieces Copilot chats.

### Interacting with Pieces Copilot

We’ll walk you through the main Copilot Chat window and touch on all of the main elements you can interact with here.

You’ll learn how to interact with Pieces Copilot, utilize flexible *Suggested Prompts* when starting new chats, enable or disable Long-Term Memory context, add individual items to the chat, and discover other productivity-centric *Quick Actions.*

### Context & Project Integration

One of Pieces Copilot’s key advantages is context awareness.

By integrating local folders, files, and your saved code snippets, you can significantly boost the relevance and accuracy of the Pieces Copilot’s AI responses.

In this section, we'll cover context and project management—adding items from Pieces Drive or your device as chat context, offering real-world examples to reduce context switching, and showing how to adjust the AI's understanding of your environment or workflow.

### Configuring Pieces Copilot

Pieces Copilot offers flexibility in choosing the AI model (cloud-based or local) and customizing the chat appearance and default context usage.

Choose from over 40 cloud-hosted and local models (including those served via Ollama and other providers), adjust your runtime settings, customize the appearance of your Copilot Chat view, enable or disable LTM context for new chats, and more.

### Pieces Copilot in Multiple Environments

If you don't want the wide range of tools designed to boost your productivity and reduce context switching in your workflow with the Pieces Desktop App—that’s fine.

You can still find Pieces plugins & extensions available in your favorite collaboration tools, text editors, and most importantly, IDEs.

We’ll go over cross-platform consistency with context, history, and usage synchronization through PiecesOS, cross-threaded use case scenarios, link you to other Pieces software, and more.
