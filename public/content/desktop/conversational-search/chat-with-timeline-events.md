## Starting a conversation with a Timeline Event

Start context-specific chats directly from any Timeline Event. When you start a conversation with a Timeline Event, it opens in Conversational Search with that event's full context pre-loaded and displayed as an information card. Use this when you want to ask questions about a specific past moment, understand what happened during a particular work session, or drill into details of a specific Timeline Event.

### Asking Questions with Pre-Loaded Context

When Conversational Search opens with a Timeline Event, you'll see an information card displaying the event's details, including its title, description, timestamp, and related participants. The input field will show a placeholder like "Ask about '[Event Name]'..." indicating that the conversation is scoped to that specific event. Type your question or click any suggested prompts that appear. The conversation already has full context from that Timeline Event, including core tasks, key decisions, documents reviewed, and follow-up actions.

**Example questions:**
* "Why did we make that decision?"
* "What were the main blockers in this session?"
* "Summarize the key outcomes from this work"
* "What happened next?"

## Working with Responses

You can copy, export, regenerate, or convert responses just like in regular Conversational Search. Responses are scoped to that specific Timeline Event's context. You can also click the `Relevant Summaries` button at the bottom of any response to see which Timeline Events were used to generate the answer, though typically only the event you're discussing will appear since the conversation is already scoped to that single Timeline Event.

## Differences from Conversational Search

Starting a conversation with a Timeline Event focuses on a single Timeline Event, while Conversational Search can access all your memories or a filtered subset. Here's how they compare:

**Starting a conversation with a Timeline Event:**
* **Context** - One specific memory with pre-loaded context
* **Filters** - Not available (context is already scoped to that memory)
* **Best for** - Questions about specific moments, understanding particular decisions, or reviewing individual work sessions

**Conversational Search:**
* **Context** - All memories or a filtered subset based on your filters
* **Filters** - Sources & Time Ranges available to narrow scope
* **Best for** - Broad workflow questions spanning multiple time periods or when you need to search across different apps

Use starting a conversation with a Timeline Event when you want to dive deep into a specific past moment. Use Conversational Search for questions spanning multiple time periods or when you need to filter by apps or dates.
