## Overview

The **Power Menu** in Pieces is a dynamic command palette. It shows certain views as 'suggested' based on the task you're working on or sorts them by how often you use them.

## Dynamic View-Based Actions

The **Power Menu** in Pieces is a dynamic command palette.

When you press the Power Menu hotkey or open it from the app interface, you’ll see different actions *depending on which view or section of the app you’re currently in*.

For example:

* **Pieces Drive View:** You’ll see commands related to creating, editing, or managing snippets (e.g., “Create New Material,” “Optimize Snippet,” etc.).

* **Conversational Search View:** You'll see commands focused on AI-driven interactions (e.g., "Ask Conversational Search," "Analyze this Snippet," etc.).

* **Application & Cloud / Global Context:** Some commands (e.g., “Check for Updates,” “Manage Accounts & Cloud Integrations,” “Go to Settings”) appear in multiple views or from a global context.

<Callout type="alert">
  If you search for a command in the Power Menu and you’re *not* in the view where that command is valid, **it will not appear** in your search results.
</Callout>

### Conversational Search

You can find lots of saved material and generative AI-focused actions when accessing the Power Menu from the Conversational Search view.
