## Overview

Single-Click Summaries are quick-access actions prominently displayed when you first open the Pieces Desktop App. These summaries generate instant, contextual insights from your workflow captured by the [Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7)](/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-27) Engine.

Each summary type adapts dynamically to your workflow, meaning the same summary type generates different results based on your current activities, captured memories, and work patterns. This makes Single-Click Summaries powerful tools for understanding your productivity, tracking progress, and identifying patterns in your work.

## Generating Summaries

Generating a single-click summary lets you quickly extract insights from your workflow without writing prompts. Click any summary card on the homepage and after a few minutes, you'll see your summary in the [Pieces Timeline](/products/desktop/timeline).

<Callout type="tip">
  You can queue multiple unique summaries at once, but wait for the current one to finish before starting another of the same type.
</Callout>
